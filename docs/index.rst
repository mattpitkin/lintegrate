lintegrate
==========

lintegrate provides a C library for `numerical integration
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration>`_ of functions for which numerical
instabilities require working with the `natural logarithm
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm>`_ of the function.

In addition to the C library, there are Python versions of several of the core methods that are
accessed in a similar way to the SciPy :func:`~scipy.integrate.quad` function.
